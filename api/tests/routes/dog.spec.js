//SUPERTEST:
// The get() method tells SuperTest that weâ€™re using the HTTP GET verb. 
// You can chain additional methods into the call for setting authentication, custom HTTP headers or body, etc.
//  but this is not necessary for this example. The end() method finalizes the request and calls the API server.
//   As its parameter, it requires a callback function for handling the response.
// You need to set your expectations for a functional API test and confirm that the API responds as expected
// As you can see, expect() calls always come before end().
// Using async and await allows you to resolve the promise to get the API response more cleanly instead of resolving the promise through chaining.
// SuperTest is smart enough to check the content type from the response and appropriately parses the information into a JavaScript object. 
// It makes verifying your JSON APIs much easier to do since you don't have to worry about parsing the response.
